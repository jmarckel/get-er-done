GetErDone SPA
=============

**GetErDone-SPA** is a JavaScript based single page application that
allows authenticated users to interact with a list of assigned tasks.
These tasks may be assigned by the GetErDone-WebApp or created on their
own. Once a user has completed a task, they may mark it done in the
application.

In order to use this application for the first time, you will need to create a user.
To create a new user, use the 'Sign Up' tab on the login screen, and enter an email
address. To create multiple accounts, enter an email address where the username is 
split with the plus ('+') sign.

Modern email services like google will deliver the email for the user
'jeff+test_one' to the inbox for 'jeff', and you can use as many aliases as
you like this way.

Once the new user is created, before the application will work correctly,
you will need to **finish the registration process** in the account
confirmation email from `techex-epoxyloaf-com`.
