GetErDone WebApp

**GetErDone-WebApp** is an html based tool allowing managers to interact
with lists of tasks to be done by others.

In order to use this application, you will need to create a user with the
role of 'manager'. To create a user with the 'manager' title, use the 'Sign Up'
tab on the login screen, and enter an email address where the username is split
with the plus ('+') sign, and the letters to the right of the '+' includes the
word 'manager'. So the user `jeff@epoxyloaf.com` would have the title 'user',
and the user `jeff+the_manager_guy@epoxyloaf.com` would have the title 'manager'.

Modern email services like google will deliver the email for the user
'jeff+test_manager' to the inbox for 'jeff', and you can use as many aliases as
you like this way.

Once the new user is created, before the application will work correctly,
you will need to **finish the registration process** in the account
confirmation email from `techex-epoxyloaf-com`.

Click `here`_ to launch the webapp.
